# Library

## Purpose
Library is the central hub for browsing saved resources without changing workouts.
It separates **Explorer** (browse/learn) from **Picker** (select-and-return).

## Access
- Library is a bottom navigation tab.
- Hub tiles link to Exercises and Gyms.

## Sections
- Exercises: Strong-style exercise library with search, filters, and detail pages.
- Gyms: workout spaces, equipment inventory, and template compatibility.
- Analytics/Settings: placeholders for future expansion.

## Navigation
Navigation config lives in `src/App.jsx` (`NAV_ITEMS`) to avoid scattered links.
