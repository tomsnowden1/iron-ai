# UX Plan

Goal: Make the app feel closer to a native fitness experience without changing functionality.

Ranked improvements (impact vs effort)
1) Clear feedback via toasts/snackbars (High impact, Low effort)
2) One-tap actions for common tasks (High impact, Low/Medium effort)
3) Stronger hierarchy + spacing consistency (Medium impact, Low effort)
4) Smarter defaults (Medium impact, Medium effort)
5) Progressive disclosure for dense screens (Medium impact, Medium effort)

Top 3 to implement now
- Clear feedback via toasts/snackbars
- One-tap actions for sets/exercises
- Hierarchy + spacing consistency across screens

Assumptions
- Alerts can be replaced with non-blocking toasts without changing core behavior.
- Adding quick actions does not remove existing controls.
- UI adjustments remain presentational only (no data schema or feature changes).
